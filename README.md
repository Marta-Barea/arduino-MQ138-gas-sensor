## 📥 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
 <pre markdown="1"> ``bash
            git clone https://github.com/Marta-Barea/arduino-MQ138-gas-sensor.git
            cd arduino-MQ138-gas-sensor </pre>

2. Open the Arduino Serial Monitor and set the baud rate to `9600`.
3. Observe the sensor readings in real-time. The output includes raw analog values, which can be processed to estimate gas concentrations.
